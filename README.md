## FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG) HA SDN connector cluster on Azure with 3 ports

A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM Cluster on Azure using a SDN connector HA topology

## Introduction
This topology is only recommended for using with FOS 7.0.5 and later which supports 3 port HA setup combining HA reserved management ports and sync into the same interfaces.
* port1 - hamgmt/hasync with public IP
* port2 - public/untrust with public IP
* port3 - private/trust

This terraform script supports both availability zones and availablity sets with a variable toggle.

## Requirements

* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider AzureRM >= 2.24.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* Terraform Provider Random >= 3.1.0

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:

* Azure Virtual Network with 4 subnets - external, internal, 2x workload subnets
* 2x FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG) instances with three NICs.  Each FortiGate-VM reside in different availability zones.
* Untrust interface placed in SD-WAN zone "Underlay".
* 2x firewall rules - permit outbound, and permit internal.
* Azure SDN connector using managed identity with reader and network contributor roles. The latter is utilised for SDN connector based HA failover. 
* 2x Ubuntu 20.04 LTS test client VMs in each workload subnet.
* UDRs for internal subnet routing table for default routing and inter-subnet routing through active FortiGate (HA is orchestrated by SDN connector)
* Choose PAYG or BYOL in variables - if BYOL, place .lic files in subfolder "licenses" and define in variables.
* Choose availability zone or availability set using the availability_zone boolean variable (false will use availability set).
* Terraform backend (versions.tf) stored in Azure storage - customise backend.conf to suit or modify as appropriate. An backend.conf.example is provided  or comment out the backend "azurerm" resource block to use the default local backend for example.

**If availability_zone is set to true, then region must support this feature. If availability_zone is set to false, then the deployment will be performed using an availability set with 2 domains.**

**Topology using default variables**

## Deployment

To deploy the FortiGate-VM to Azure:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables defined in `variables.tf` file as needed with a standard *.auto.tfvars file. An example is provided.
3. Initialize the providers defining the backend (terraform init -backend-config=backend.conf) and run terraform as normal.

Outputs:

- ActiveMGMTPublicIP = <Active FGT Management Public IP>
- ClusterPublicIP = <Cluster Public IP>
- PassiveMGMTPublicIP = <Passive FGT Management Public IP>
- Password = <FGT Password>
- ResourceGroup = <Resource Group>
- Username = <FGT admin>
- VNET_CIDR = <vnet summary route>

Azure credentials:

The following code is commented out in provider.tf that can be uncommented to run via a service principal

- subscription_id = var.subscription_id
- client_id       = var.client_id
- client_certificate_path   = var.client_certificate_path
- tenant_id       = var.tenant_id

The client_id and client_certificate_path variables are only required for this purpose.

## Acknowledgements
This template was developed from the starting point of https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-terraform-deploy/tree/main/azure/7.2/ha-port1-mgmt-crosszone-3ports and then enhanced with availability zone / availablity set selection, managed identity SDN connector etc.
References to custom images are commented out.
